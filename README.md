# Embryo-Image-Classifier
This project focuses on classifying embryo images into different developmental stages—such as 8-cell, Morula, and Blastocyst—using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on labeled microscope images and uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate stage identification, which can aid in improving decision-making in IVF procedures.
